                make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
